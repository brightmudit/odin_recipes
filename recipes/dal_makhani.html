    <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Dal makhani is a popular Punjabi dish made from whole black lentils (sabut urad) and red kidney beans (rajmah) and/or adzuki beans. It’s cooked with butter (makhan) and cream (malai), which gives the finished dish a smooth, creamy texture. Given the addition of butter and cream, this dish has a rich mouthfeel, with a complex combination of dried and fresh spices and herbs, with just a hint of smokiness.</p>
